        <p class="post-preview-summary">Session reports for the first four sessions of my open table Mythic Bastionland game, played sporadically over summer. Seven of my friends played across these sessions, but we unfortunately didn't get to play much. It's been amazing from the referee side, very easy to prep and a lot of fun to run. The final combat (an omen from the Catacombs) was brutal, the first time I've properly seen the high lethality of this kind of game.
