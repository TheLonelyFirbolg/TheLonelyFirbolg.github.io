My entry for the Summer LEGO setting jam, a borough for electric bastionland inspired by the 3-in-1 LEGO create sets that were around when I was a kid. I was struggling a bit for ideas, since these lack the nostalgia factor of more charming older LEGO sets, but realised the 3 option sets acted like their own spark tables. In Bastionland fashion I've tried to stay concise throughout here, and have mostly followed the structure of example boroughs in the book. The result is pretty tied to that game, but hopefully there's space for Creatown in any weird and wacky city with a vaguely modern setting.

Also, while searching around for this I discovered [rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/mocs/?theme=672), a website where people have made their own creations out of existing sets, which fits perfectly with the 3-in-1 idea and could be another cool source of inspiration for anyone else creating something for the jam.
