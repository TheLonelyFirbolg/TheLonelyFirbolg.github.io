First attempts to hack Mythic Bastionland into a monster of the week game.

[Part 1](https://thelonelyfirbolg.github.io/spn_bastionland/supernatural-bastionland/) sets out the project.

Yesterday, I suggested that two issues with this idea were the random nature of myths in Mythic Bastionland compared to the more localised and focused nature of monster of the week stories. An initial idea to get around this, and to incorporate the turning of seasons, is introducing a longer monster myth whose omens are triggered on a roll of 1 on the wilderness die. This also makes monsters more local, with a 2-3 on the wilderness roll always triggering an omen from the nearest monster. When the longer myth is resolved, turn a season.

I also thought about linking equipment to cars. The idea here would be that you have a wider set of equipment since hunters are dealing with different monsters each session, so linking equipment to the whole party rather than each player could make more sense.
