Eat your mother's heart and lungs and liver. She knew three things you didn't. Now you do. Leave the rest of her to the world.

When you would face death by heartbreak, suffocation or poison, you may sacrifice the relevant organ and with it the associated knowledge.

When your own daughter one day kills you, she may eat all remaining organs and gain the associated knowledge. 

Once some descendent of yours has more than 3 hearts or 3 lungs or 3 livers, she may give up one of these excess organs and its associated knowledge to a daughter of hers without sacrificing her life. This daughter now begins along the same path you walked once.

Knowledge is a template, if you like.
