Jumping on the elements blogging bandwagon, this was the first chemistry-dnd pun I came up with.

Displacement reactions are where a more reactive element replaces a less reactive one within a compound (AB+C->A+CB). They're [cool](https://youtu.be/8d6T500BRwY), exactly how I imagined science experiments would be like when I was a kid. We had to learn the reactivity series of metals in school using some mnemonic about zebras, but dnd-type games are full of numbers, so it's much easier to work out whether something is more or less X than something else. There are of course plenty of similar monsters out there (mind flayers perhaps an obvious example) but hopefully this spin brings something a little different.

**Displacement Beasts** look like something else, behaving strangely and maybe a little more intelligent behind the eyes, but normal enough. Until they open their mouths, revealing too many teeth as well as grasping thin strands that float where their tongues should be.

**Stats** as whatever creature they have most recently displaced, with the following changes:
- *Intelligence* noticeably higher than expected for the creature (e.g. wolf as smart as a monkey). If the form has language however, they are not very good at speaking (too many teeth, always trying to hide their mouth).
- *Disposition* depends on whether they are encountered in the proximity of a higher HD creature. If not, roll 2d6

| 2d6 | | |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 5-| **Hungry** | Forgot that this form needs to eat. Will attack until hurt or fed. |
| 6-8 | **Disinterested** | It can't displace you so what's the point. |
| 9+ | **Curious** | Looking for a more powerful creature to displace. May follow at a reasonable distance, or try and communicate if its form allows. |

If yes, scheming to displace the highest HD creature nearby.
- *Attacks* against higher HD creatures can deal displacement damage instead of normal damage, tracked separately to normal damage. If displacement damage is greater than the target's current health (i.e. sum of normal and displacement damage has reduced the target to 0), floaty tendrils from the displacement beast's mouth swap the spirits of the displacement beast and its target. 
- *Bite* [HD/2]d4 damage.

**Displacement Damage** represents the reaction as a target is replaced by the displacement beast. Describe them gaining attributes of the displacement beast's current form and let this change the target's stats or behaviour during the course of the combat. Being reduced to zero knocks you out for a few minutes, and you awaken in the body of the current form. A few minutes rest away from the displacement beast will remove this damage, but receiving a scar (or equivalent in your system) results in gaining permanently an attribute of the current form. 

**Tactics** The displacement beast always focuses the single highest HD target. As it is always fighting at a disadvantage, it relies on its intelligence and the element of surprise that its form grants it. It will use rudimentary traps, environmental features, and other creatures to try and reduce the target's health before swooping in to displace it while it's weak. It is a delicate balance though, as the beast will need enough strength to get away somewhere safer, before its target awakens in its previous body.

**Encounter Design** This could be an effective recurring encounter. The party encounter some dungeon beast, say a wolf, trying to walk on two legs (it is actually the displaced soul of an orc). Later on, they meet the orc tribe settled here and their companion disappears in the night, an orc approaching the party the next morning and claiming to be them. The next time the party face the beast, it is uninterested in them- until eventually, they are higher HD than its current form. Now it searches them out, crude traps litter their established routes through the dungeon and when they encounter it they know exactly what they're getting into. I do think it could be particularly fun with less intelligent creatures though, where the party keep running into animals that are just *strange*. If the party are ever the target, make sure the displacement beast has done its best to stack the odds in its favour, any way that it can.
The displacement beast is very suited to a dungeon, where it acts as a kind of solo chaos faction, causing problems for everyone. The closed environment and clear areas mean it should be pretty obvious (to referee and players once they work out what's going on) which creature will be the next target. It is also an easy monster to exploit. Lead a more powerful enemy into its domain and that enemy has a new problem. Trap some great beast in a humanoid body if you want to chat to it. Use illusion or conjuration to lure the displacement beast then capture it. Just remember it will always be looking to 'level up' as it were, and is very crafty.

**Treasure** Capturing the beast is probably the best treasure, but its tendrils can be harvested too. They are surprisingly stretchy and allow communication between any two creatures (even usually unintelligible ones) with an end in their mouth, accompanied by enormous empathy with the other creature. Though organic, so susceptible to decay, and hard to carry, they could be used in crafting psychic-themed items. Wearing a necklace of displacement beast teeth protects you from possession and other types of soul swapping/stealing.
