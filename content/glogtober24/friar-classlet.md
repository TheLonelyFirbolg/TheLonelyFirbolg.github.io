**Mendicant:** You have taken a vow of poverty. You may not hold property beyond the bare essentials and you rely on the charity of strangers to survive. Where there are people, you can always find someone who will take you in for a night. Roll d4 in a village, d6 in a town and d8 in a city, and make a reaction roll for their attitude towards this duty.
| |Abode|
|:---|:---|
|1|Glorious hovel|
|2|Dreary cottage|
|3|Busy stable|
|4|Secluded monastery|
|5|Imposing market|
|6|Decadent manor|
|7|Penitent brothel|
|8|Erudite cathedral|

**Spiritual:** You have -1 reaction vs academics and clericals, and +1 vs lay folk and nobles. If you make a show of refusing or giving up material goods in a situation where it will certainly harm you, all onlookers hold Espirit for you.

**Preacher:** With an hour or two (or within a similarly long Church ceremony), your words attain a kind of power. All who attend the whole sermon may receive either a small blessing or have a suggestion implanted if they are neutral or friendly to you. These should be tailored to the sermon (e.g. +d4 to attack rolls against [Huguenots](https://pilgrimtemple.blogspot.com/2025/08/chose-you-out-of-world.html) in next hour following a rabble-rousing sermon against them).

**Hierarchy:** Start as a Friar Minor, like the bulk of your order. There is a wider hierarchy:
- *Novices* obey unquestioningly
- *Friars Minor* question obediently
- *Provincials* scheme endlessly
- The *Minister General* negotiates desperately
- The *Cardinal* is your ultimate ruler

While violence is not encouraged, you may brawl over theological matters with those of your rank, and are permitted to chastise those below your rank.

**Beneath the cowl:** Your itinerant lifestyle is as a disguise. 3-in-6 you are mistaken for a different friar when meeting someone for the first time. 

**Cardinals' man:** While you may believe in the legitimacy of the Cardinal or anti-Cardinal, whenever you meet a new noble or clerical aligned with the other Cardinal, they mistake you for a different friar in the service of their Cardinal and hold Espirit for you. If you allow the deception to continue, it is always revealed at the most inopportune moment later on.

**Unerring faith:** You have resistance to mental effects which would compromise your beliefs.

**Mend-i-can:** In brawls, ruckuses and other public fights and nuisances, you cannot be killed. If you are reduced to 0 HP, you are instead beaten, left at the town gates, and told never to return.

**Heresy:** You may believe in one heresy, which gives you a particular ability. Once ever, you may choose to raise a village of believers through a passionate display of your heretical belief. They hold Espirit for you, and will follow your commands for a week. After this point, X-in-6 chance you lose control of the group where X is number of weeks. If this roll fails, you can choose to maintain control by adopting an additional heresy. All others will oppose you, unless you convince a Cardinal of the truth of your belief, in which case your group disperses nonviolently and only those associated with the other Cardinal will pursue you.

|1d4|Example heresies|
|:---|:---|
|1|*Holy poverty. The vow of poverty should apply to all the church.* Wear a hair shirt (DR1) under your robe. You can withstand any extreme conditions.|
|2|*Demiurge. A powerful devil created the material world to distract us from spiritual truth.* Take a whip. You feel no pain and can act as though uninjured so long as you are not dead.|
|3|*Free love. The church does not have authority over matters of the heart.* You are master of your heart and may kiss or marry who you wish. You have resistance to all charm effects.|
|4|*Predetermined afterlife. Human action has no bearing on the next life.* Take a detached disposition. You always save successfully against madness and angels can see you.|

**Theology of signs:** You are obsessed with an interpretive technique encountered in your travels, to make sense of a world overburdened in meaning. Once per day you may use it to answer a single yes or no question. First declare the sign, then after the GM has answered, justify the answer through the declared sign. Those who hold Espirit for you will completely believe any guidance given through this technique, though if you knowingly lead them to their doom with false guidance, you lose faith in the technique and may not use this ability until you discover a different technique and become obsessed with it.
