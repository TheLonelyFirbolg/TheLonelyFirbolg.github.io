[Gustave Moreau](https://mdl.artvee.com/ft/406844mt.jpg)

**A tasteless ditty; skewers the Underschloss's new wing**

*A collosal bridge between kingdoms; collapses under too little weight*

**A vein of ore; grows a dwarflength for every fool who mines it**

*An ancient seed trapped in stone; petrifies all surrounding soil when planted*

**A hardened sky-rock; hammered products melt under moonlight**

*An iron songbird; most harrowing melodies conjure walls and bars from the earth*

**A singular berry-ale; any drunk off it sing only their own song until new moon**

*A rooted bouquet of glimmering metal flowers; speaks any secret it hears to the Underspire's sanctum*

**An unlikely secret; surprised to journey so far**

*Stonewood javelin; breaks apart upon landing in soil, implanting an elderwood sapling*

**An amber cathedral; old grudges in the foundations, new poems decorating rafters**

*A ring; supple stone woven like delicate wood and inlaid wood finessed to opalescence*
