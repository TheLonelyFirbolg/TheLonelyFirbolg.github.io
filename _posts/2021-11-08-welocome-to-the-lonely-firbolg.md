Hi! I'm Phoebe, this is The Lonely Firbolg, where I'll be posting about D&D, music, bad tv I like and maybe some birds. I'm a first year physics student at Bristol who is mostly thinking about D&D and being gay. While this blog will cover a range of stuff, the main focus will be D&D. I have a world I hope to DM in, and I'll put a lot up about that which should include homebrew anyone could use for their own game, as well as more general resources and some thoughts or stories to do with D&D.
