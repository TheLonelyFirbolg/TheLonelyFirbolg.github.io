    <h1>GLoGtober: Imaginal Diskworld</h1>
    <p>A premise inspired by an album.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span><h2 id="when-the-earth-updated-it-shed-its-deep-cocoon-of-earth-and-grime-to-reveal-a-truer-inner-form-the-disk">When the Earth updated, it shed its deep cocoon of earth and grime to reveal a truer inner form: The Disk.</h2>
<p>The disk is round, as all life is. Sharp angles breed monstrous forms, vampires and demons both.</p>
<p>The disk is shiny, visible from afar. Alien life has noticed, creeps ever closer.</p>
<p>The disk is true, a searing insight. Studious angels orbit watchfully, unafraid of its dark side.</p>
<h2 id="it-was-a-difficult-update">It was a difficult update.</h2>
<p>Time is unstable, ravaging the centre of the disk yet unfelt at its edges. Some wage war on time, others seek the storm's eye.</p>
<p>The disk's rough side remains uninhabitable, at least to humans. Enhancements, television, and diskinsertion can alter the odds.</p>
<p>In the disk's image were all other disks created. Insertion grants powerful abilities, at personal risk.</p>
<h2 id="life-on-the-disk">Life on the disk.</h2>
<p>Everyone seeks something. Vampire hunters seek vampires, alien dancers seek sharper, stranger moves. Many seek love, in one form or another. </p>
<p>Freedom from a 3-dimensional planet brought relief to many, but time is a constant, tumultuous presence. It is short at the centre, but crawls slowly at the edges.</p>
<p>Death&amp;Romance. Fear,Sex. That's my floor.</p>
