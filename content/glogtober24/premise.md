A premise inspired by an album.

## When the Earth updated, it shed its deep cocoon of earth and grime to reveal a truer inner form: The Disk. 

The disk is round, as all life is. Sharp angles breed monstrous forms, vampires and demons both.

The disk is shiny, visible from afar. Alien life has noticed, enroaching more and more.

The disk is true, a searing insight. Studious angels orbit watchfully, unafraid of its dark side.

## It was a difficult update.

Time is unstable, ravaging the centre of the disk yet unfelt at its edges. Some wage war on time, others seek the storm's eye.

The rough side of the disk is still uninhabitable, at least to humans. Enhancements, television, and diskinsetion can alter the odds.

In the disk's image were all other disks created. Insertion can grant powerful abilities, at personal risk.

## Life on the disk.

Everyone seeks something. Vampire hunters seek vampires, alien dancers seek sharper, stranger moves. Many seek love, in one form or another. 

Freedom from a 3-dimensional planet brought relief to many, but time is a constant, tumultuous presence. It is short at the centre, but crawls slowly at the edges.

Death&Romance. Fear,Sex. That's my floor.
