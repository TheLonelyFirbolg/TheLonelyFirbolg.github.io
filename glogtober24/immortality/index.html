<p>Eat your mother's heart and lungs and liver. She knew three things you didn't. Now you do. Leave the rest of her to the world.</p>
<p>When you would face death by heartbreak, suffocation or poison, you may sacrifice the relevant organ and with it the associated knowledge.</p>
<p>When your own daughter one day kills you, she may eat all remaining organs and gain the associated knowledge. </p>
<p>Once some descendent of yours has more than 3 hearts or 3 lungs or 3 livers, she may give up one of these excess organs and its associated knowledge to a daughter of hers without sacrificing her life. This daughter now begins along the same path you walked once.</p>
<p>Knowledge is a template, if you like. </p>
