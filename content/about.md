Hi, I'm Phoebe, this is The Lonely Firbolg, and I'll be posting here about ttrpgs. I'm mainly experienced with 5e dnd but have spread out into osr-adjacent and storygame systems over the last year. 

### Series
* [Play Reports](https://thelonelyfirbolg.github.io/play_report/)
* [A Revisionist History of Roke](https://thelonelyfirbolg.github.io/revisionistroke/ )
* [The 12 Days of Critmas](https://thelonelyfirbolg.github.io/critmas/)

### Contact
I haven't figured out how to add comments and stuff, so email me at thelonelyfirbolg@gmail.com if you want to get in touch about a post or anything else. I check the inbox about once a week.
