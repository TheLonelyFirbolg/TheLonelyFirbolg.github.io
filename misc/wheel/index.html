    <h1>The Wheel Realm (Mythic Bastionland)</h1>
    <p>A campaign frame for Mythic Bastionland, inspired a bit by <a href="https://lunarflaneur.blogspot.com/2025/04/the-west-passage.html">The West Passage</a>, which I'm halfway through.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>Build a realm. Place the seat of power at the centre, with the other holdings in an approximate triangle around it. Try to place some natural obstacles to divide the realm roughly equally between these three holdings.</p>
<p>At the centre of the realm, The Wheel of Seasons (p91). Understood and controlled by the Summer Court, the justification for their continued rulership of the realm. Around one holding, spring; the next, harvest; the last, winter. When the season would turn, rotate the seasons between each holding. To punish or reward, the Summer Court may turn the season faster or slower. The Summer Court ride to whichever holding is currently in harvest, and rule from there.</p>
<h3 id="pair-with-these-myths-once-players-get-the-gist">Pair With These Myths (once players get the gist)</h3>
<ol>
<li>The Elf (p69): introduce this once the players know the various seers and factions controlling each holding. The Omens' interactions with seasons take on a whole new meaning here. This could also make a good closing Myth to a campaign set in this realm.</li>
<li>The Sun (p85): think about how a burning sun affects each season differently and upsets the balance of power- there are more powerful forces than the court or indeed the wheel.</li>
<li>The Ogre (p97): similar to the Sun, snow falling over the realm will worsen the winter especially and shows again the Summer Court's weakness.</li>
<li>The Wheel (p91): another possible closer. We set up the Wheel as controlled by the Summer Court, presumably a dynasty founded by a knight who once encountered this Myth, only to discover they are at its whims like anyone else. Perhaps they lost the knowledge long ago, or they do know but are held back in some other way.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also bear in mind that in a world where a faction controls the changing of seasons, Myths such as the Lich (p103), where seers would know that something terrifying is happening at the season turn, PCs have another way to intervene.</p>
