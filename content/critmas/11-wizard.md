Super short one today, because individualism is a scam.
<!-- more -->

The only damage increasing wizard subclasses are bladesinging and war magic, and of these bladesinging offers a whole extra attack, whereas war magic only gives a +4 once per turn. So, take a bladesinging variant human wizard with GWM, weapon master and metamagic adept. They cast haste on themselves the previous turn, make 3 greatsword attacks, then quicken blight, dealing a total of 136 (1d12 +2 +10 +1d12 +2 +10 +1d12 +2 +10 +8d8) in their turn. With successive crits, that increases to 172.

Tomorrow, Iâ€™ll take a look at some of the reasons this series is stupid, and maybe offer some balm in the form of some fun and interesting non-damage-whore builds or character ideas.
