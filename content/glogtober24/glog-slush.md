I'm about to be really busy, so here's where I got with my last few prompts. [GLAUGUST](https://nothicseye.blogspot.com/2025/07/g-l-u-g-u-s-t-2-0-2-5.html) got me back into blogging over summer and I'm especially grateful to [this fantastic entry](https://wasitlikely.blogspot.com/2025/07/im-yelling-parkour-but-in-way-that-lets.html) through which I became aware of it.

### A recipe

Melt 100g salted butter, 75g golden syrup and 75g brown sugar over a low heat, until it's a nice golden brown gloop. Take off the heat and add 200g oats (I recommend a mix of jumbo and normal). Mix it all together and put the mix in a greased or lined baking tray. Cook at 180C for about 30 minutes. This is the only way to make flapjacks. 

### Into the nanodungeon
I spent a bit of time at a synchrotron once, where they use high energy X-rays to investigate all kinds of things. These give nanoscale information that can be interpreted to understand macroscale phenomena. I thought about adapting the concept into a science-fantasy dungeon, where they were harnessing power from a meteorite, and there was a religious aspect to the investigations (a bit like Dust in His Dark Materials). Also shady monks probably. The players would be able to use the equipment in their own investigations and there would be various materials whose properties they could learn about then exploit. I remember a blogpost about a process dungeon (I can't remember who wrote it, sorry) where the idea was that the dungeon is a kind of factory and as the players learn about the production processes these are another kind of tool to be exploited. This would be kind of similar. 

Dust appears more interesting than it ends up being (spoilers it's either dark matter or angels or maybe both), but there are some cool rules established early on, like it doesn't interact with children, only adults. This is the kind of more gameable angle the strange materials would take, but with some particular effect that is intuitive enough to understand.

### Paladin of an unorthodox Law or 6 prisoners in an extradimensional prison

A Lake, Lady

B Sword, Stone, +2 prisoners

C Table, Traitor

D Green, Grail, +2 prisoners


You follow one law- the king that was once will never be again. From B, they are delta templates. Are they also flip templates? Maybe...

**Lake:** You are a body of water. Those under or within you begin to drown. When you drown someone, you can choose to instead imprison them under your lake. 

You can have up to 2 prisoners (more at B and D). If you try to imprison more than you have space for, a random prisoner is freed. Imprisoned beings do not age and are freed if you die, unless you yourself drown, in which case you join them.

**Lady:** You are a lady. Your enemies will kidnap you before killing you, your friends will fall in love with you, and you will always impress in polite society.

**Sword:** Drown a warrior. While they are imprisoned, you are proficient in weapons they use and gain an additional effect when you hit with an attack (grab, topple, disarm, etc., target saves at DM's discretion).

**Stone:** Drown a druid. While they are imprisoned, you can speak to trees, stones and small creatures, and your fingernails grow hard and sharp (d4).

**Table:** Drown a king. While they are imprisoned, you gain 1 MD for use casting *Charm*, *Command*, or *Spectacle*.

**Traitor:** Drown someone you trust. While they are imprisoned, you gain 1 MD for use casting *Disguise*, *Filch* or *Hypnotize*.

**Green:** Drown a fey spirit. While they are imprisoned, all beasts swear fealty to you and you will not age.

**Grail:** Drown a divine creature. While they are imprisoned, the devout treat you as a saint and you can quell interlopers with divine fire (d12).
