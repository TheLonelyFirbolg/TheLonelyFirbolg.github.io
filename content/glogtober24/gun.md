Schemes from Grackle Court's fantastic [Mastermind Class](https://gracklecourt.blogspot.com/2025/02/mastermind-class.html) with a couple small changes, so it's effectively that but stupider.

Starting skills: 1. Surveying. 2. Engineering. 3. Sweating.

**A.** 2 Schemes, Here's to Paying Guests!

**B.** +1 Scheme, Have You Seen This Chicken?

**C.** +1 Scheme, The Wrong Trousers

**D.** +1 Scheme, Never Bring A Rolling Pin To A Gun Fight

**Schemes** You can keep 3 schemes going at a time. When starting up a new scheme, the GM secretly rolls d4 to see if your new scheme interferes with an old scheme. On a 4 or number matching an empty slot, all is well. Pick which of your three slots the new scheme takes and gracefully wind down the old scheme in that slot without issue. Otherwise, the scheme occupying that slot implodes, causing the Backlash indicated for the imploded scheme. You only become aware of this when you encounter the effects of the Backlash.
Learn two schemes off the list below when taking your first level, and one additional scheme with each subsequent level.

**Here's To Paying Guests!** When you attempt to bribe someone with gifts or favours, even if they refuse the bribe, their disposition towards you improves.

**Have You Seen This Chicken?** Produce a simple yet devious disguise to use as an alter ego. Those who know you will act suspicious, but are unable to recognise you unless you change in front of them.

**The Wrong Trousers.** Embroil someone innocent in a scheme of yours. They are unaware of their involvement until the scheme implodes, at which point they suffer the Backlash, but uncover your disguise. This does not necessarily mean they know you are the one who embroiled them.

**Never Bring A Rolling Pin To A Gun Fight.** When an enemy initiates combat by challenging you with a weapon, produce a gun from behind your back. The gun has 6 shots then breaks irreparably.

**Schemes List** 

1. **Identity Theft.** Choose a target. Given a couple of weeks, you move into their room, replace them in their social circles, and otherwise take up their home/personal life. Backlash: those in their life realise they've been manipulated. You lose their trust.
2. **Mass Theft.** Choose a fairly common item or type of item. You accumulate a large supply of these through small scale thefts from a large number of holders. Backlash: The items are noticed missing and you are caught if any are still in your possession (even secretly)
3. **Secret Sanctum.** With an hour in a room that you possess all the keys to, you can establish it as a secret sanctum. It has ten hidden inventory slots and one hidden trap or escape route. Backlash: The sanctum, its inventory slots and trap/escape route are all discovered.
4. **Grand Larceny.** Gain a random valuable or useful item that could be found in a chosen public building. Backlash: If still in your possession, you are caught red-handed with the item. If it is no longer in your possession, someone powerful comes seeking compensation.
5. **Spread Rumours.** Start a rumour. It continues to be treated as credible for as long as this scheme continues and you will receive regular updates about any decisions made on the basis of this rumour. Backlash: if the rumour was false, it dies down. If true, you are revealed as its original source.
6. **Secret Society of Gnomes.** Choose a secret goal and up to a dozen robots or gnomes. You intuit which of these would act in secret to support the goal and can invite any number of them to a secret meeting. Backlash: The least loyal/discreet member invited reveals your secret goal and the identity of another member.
