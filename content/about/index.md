Hi, I'm Phoebe, this is The Lonely Firbolg, and I'll be posting here about D&D, music, bad tv I like and maybe some other stuff. The main focus will probably be D&D, as I'm normally on the verge of talking way too much about it, and I really enjoy making homebrew, as well as just sharing thoughts and stories about the game.
