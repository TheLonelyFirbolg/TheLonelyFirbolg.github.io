Hi, I'm Phoebe, this is The Lonely Firbolg, and I'll be posting here about ttrpgs, music, bad tv I like and maybe some other stuff. The main focus will probably be ttrpgs, as I'm normally on the verge of talking way too much about them, and I really enjoy making homebrew, as well as just sharing thoughts and stories.

### Series
