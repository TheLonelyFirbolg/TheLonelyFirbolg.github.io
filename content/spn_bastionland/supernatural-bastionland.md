Alone in the Labarynth recently posted about [adapting Into The Odd for superheroes](https://aloneinthelabyrinth.blogspot.com/2025/12/in-wake-of-fallen-goddess-mark-of-odd.html). I haven't figured that out, but it did make me realise there's something mythic going on in Supernatural.

Supernatural ended up being about querbait and all powerful self-inserts, but it started life as a monster of the week show about two monster hunters travelling around the US chasing clues and rumours and their dad. Each episode featured escalating monster attacks as the main characters researched or stumbled their way into figuring out what was going on before some final confrontation. Recurring side characters included other hunters and characters with unusual or forbidden knowledge. 

The following changes could be made to mythic bastionland to support this kind of story:

- Horses are cars.
- Knights are hunters.
- Hex map is the USA (or part of it).
- Myths are monsters. Hunters encounter clues or impacts first, that escalate into confrontations.
- Seers are those with unusual knowledge. Strange librarians, retired hunters, cultists.

Upfront, one obvious difference is the random nature of Myth encounters compared to the traditional one monster a week structure of the show. There's similarly a problem with the more location based aspect of each monster hook. But with a selective rewatch of the early seasons, some more free time in the next few weeks, and an unscratched itch for an osr-ish monster of the week rpg, I'm going to give this idea a go. Stay tuned for more.
